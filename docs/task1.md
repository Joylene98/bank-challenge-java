**Introduction**

The digital era has changed the way users manage their finances. Online banking has equipped users with the right tools to allow users to be in control of their financial data. To further continue this change, I propose a banking console application that helps users to conduct banking activities more efficiently. The banking console app prevents a user from having visit a bank to conduct banking related tasks. The console banking app allows the user to access their account, deposit funds into their account, withdraw funds from their account and print their account statement.

- **Improve customer experience:** The console banking app helps to improve the customer experience as the application is always available. This allows you to be rest assured that the customer needs will always be fulfilled at any time. Also, by collecting customer's data, you can understand the customer's behaviour. This information can be used to suggest options that can be useful for the customer when using the app. This can result to increased customer satisfaction and it will help improve your reputation positively.

With the console banking app, customers can view their statement online which helps to reduce the use of paper. Also, this saves time for the customer as customers do not need to wait for their bank statement to arrive via post. Also, the app allows you to save money on having to open branches and helps to reduce the need of employees as well.

So, whenever a customer makes a withdraw or deposit, this is recorded on their statement. This helps the customer to keep track of the activities on their account.
